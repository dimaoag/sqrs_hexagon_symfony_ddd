### About
This is an example of implementation and my vision of **practical** CQRS, DDD, ADR, hexagonal architecture and directory structure.
Project has entities `Task` and `User`.
All UI is the REST endpoints.

### What is done
* Hexagonal Architecture (`Ports` directory for external endpoints)
* CQRS (based on symfony messenger component command/query buses with middlewares)
* DDD: directory structure (used sensiolabs-de/deptrac to control layers dependencies)
* DDD: core bounded context
* DDD: domain events implementation
* DDD: example of specification in User entity that requires a db query

### To do
* Add another bounded context
* Add anti-corruption layer for interaction between contexts

### My assumptions
* I placed entities public getters and private setters into the traits with *GS suffix to make entities a little bit clear (phpstorm tracks fine all references to entity classes) anyway you can put getters with setters in the same class
* Unfortunately mysql has a poor performance with primary uuids. Of course prefer application generated uuid if database supports them.

### How to install the project
* `bash setup_env.sh dev` - to setup .env.local docker/.env
* `make dc_build` - docker-compose build
* `make dc_up` - docker-compose up 
* `make setup_dev` - composer install, migrations and so on
* `make run php bin/console app:create-user` - create a user
* `http://127.0.0.1:888/api/doc` `https://127.0.0.1:444/api/doc` - api doc

### Some words about docker
In project is used workplace container for code manipulations, CI or building. It was created for preventing of pollution
of working containers (php-fpm) of unused in request, building tools like nodejs, composer, dev libs and so on.
Also was created a local user based on host machine user PUID PGID to resolve conflicts with file permissions.

`make dev` - jump into workplace container

### CI
```
make dev
//in container execute
make analyze
```

### Implementation
Used symfony messenger component to create transactional command bus, query bus and event bus.
Query model represented by DTOs. Domain and Command layers are covered by unit tests.
